# Data Set Summary & Exploration

## 1. Basic summary of the data set. 
I used numpy to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:
* The size of the training set is (34799, 32, 32, 3)
* The size of the validation set is (4410, 32, 32, 3)
* The size of the testing set is (12630, 32, 32, 3)
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43.

## 2. Visualization of the dataset.
I first looked at random samples of each class to get a better understanding of the data. For each class, I took 10 samples and displayed them. This allowed me to have a qualitative familiarity with the dataset.

The ten samples from the class 'Speed limit (50km/h) is shown below. For samples of all the classes, please see the attached html files.

I looked at the distribution of labels in the training, validation and test sets. The distributions are included below.
